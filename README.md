**Interactive Penetration Testing Demo:** A key feature of the website is an interactive demo where users can simulate a Reflected XSS attack on a vulnerable contact form. This demonstration allows users to witness firsthand how personal data can be exploited from a vulnerable page versus a secure one. It provides a hands-on learning experience that deepens understanding of XSS attacks and the importance of secure coding practices.

**Comparison Between Vulnerable and Secure Forms:** The demo clearly illustrates the difference between a vulnerable form and a secure form, showcasing how proper input validation and sanitization can prevent XSS attacks.
